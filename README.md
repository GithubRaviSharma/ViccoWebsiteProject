# Vikas Cable Company Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the newly designed website for Vikas Cable Company. Vikas Cable Company, a medium-scale manufacturer, had an outdated and dull-looking website. As a Computer Science student, I took on the task of creating a fresh and more professional website to better represent the company's brand and offerings.

## Features

- **Modern Design:** A clean, professional look that aligns with current web design trends.
- **Responsive Layout:** The website is fully responsive and works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Improved Navigation:** Enhanced user experience with intuitive navigation and accessible information.
- **Product Showcase:** Detailed pages for products with high-quality images and descriptions.
- **Contact Form:** A functional contact form to allow potential customers to get in touch easily.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic content.
- **TailwindCSS:** For creating various structures and styling.
